                    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on at the centre of which is a
                    22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch  a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding
                    team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's 
                    wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's
                    goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places
                    with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each 
                   of these swaps.
