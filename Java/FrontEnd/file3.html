    <p class="box-1">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played 
        between two teams of eleven players on a field,
        at the centre of which is a
        22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with
        a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
        (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two 
        players from the batting team, 
        the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either
        wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding
        team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's 
        wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's
        goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places
        with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each 
        of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary 
        of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>
